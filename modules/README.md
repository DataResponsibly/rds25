This folder contains the module content for the course. Inside every module folder, you should create a special folder called `_posts`, eg. `fairness/_posts`. Inside the folder called `_posts`, you should create a file for every section in the module. The name of the file should start with the date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-sectionname.md`. The date determines the order of the sections in your module.

An example of the file layout for this course:

```
modules/fairness/_posts/2000-01-01-week1.md
modules/fairness/_posts/2000-01-01-week2.md
modules/fairness/_posts/2000-01-01-week3.md
